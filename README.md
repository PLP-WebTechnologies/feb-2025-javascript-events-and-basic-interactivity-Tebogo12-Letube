**I created a functional webpage that demonstrates the following JavaScript concepts:**
Use event listeners effectively. Implement form validation. Add interactive elements.]is the actual assignment

**for this assignment,i tried for:**
Real-Time Form Validation → Instead of waiting for submission errors, I validated inputs as the user types.
Animated Success Message → After submission, the confirmation text fades in smoothly instead of appearing instantly. Interactive Buttons → Clicking the button has a subtle bounce effect, making interactions feel more responsive.
Error Tooltips → Instead of simple red text, errors appear in small tooltips near the input fields.
Dark/Light Mode Toggle → Users could switch between light and dark themes for better accessibility
